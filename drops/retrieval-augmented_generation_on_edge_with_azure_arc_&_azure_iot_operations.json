  "Title": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Edge with Azure Arc & Azure IoT Operations",
  "Summary": "This Drop provides a Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) on edge pattern that facilitates text searches within files utilizing a local vectorDB and an edge LLM. It follows Pub/Sub messaging pattern with Arc-enabled Azure IoT Operations MQTT broker.",
  "Description": "RAG on Edge is a tool to perform text searches within files using a vector-based approach, and generate a readable response based on the search result with Large/Small Language Model. The solution is independent from cloud services, and can be deployed to the edge device. The messaging system follows a pub/sub pattern, ensuring adaptability to diverse edge computing scenarios.",
