## Overview



### Drop Details
The lab environment provides you with a virtual lab environment, including a physical Hyper-V server running Windows Server 2025 which allows you to run virtual machines. This allows you to leverage this as a platform to run Arc Jumpstart scenarios to try adaptive cloud solutions for hybrid cloud and edge scenarios. It also includes the possibilities to test Azure services such as:

Arc-enabled servers
Arc-enabled SQL Server
Arc-enabled Kubernetes
Arc-enabled data services
Arc-enabled app services
Arc-enabled machine learning
Arc, Edge, and Azure IoT Operations
Arc and Azure Lighthouse
AKS ena

## Development Artifacts
### Windows Server 2025 Evaluation version
The Azure Adaptive Cloud Lab Kit x Arc Jumpstart consists of, and is built by using an Intel NUC, NUC stands for Next Unit of Computing and is a line of small-form-factor barebone computer kits designed by Intel. The advantage of this machine is the small formfactor, low power consumption and almost no fan noise.
